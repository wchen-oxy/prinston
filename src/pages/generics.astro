          Generic pharmaceutical drugs are drugs that have the same clinical
          effect on the body as the brand-name drug they are based upon. They
          are identical in dosage, safety, effectiveness, strength, stability,
          quality and usage. This similarity is possible due to the same active
          ingredient and the rigorous testing that generic drugs go through
          during the certification process. <br /><br />Generic pharmaceutical
          drugs differ from the original brand-name drug primarily in production
          process and in overall cost. They do not have to repeat clinical
          studies that have been already been conducted by brand-name medicines
          and do not have the same upfront research costs. Additionally, generic
          pharmaceuticals can be formulated in a different, more affordable
          method than the brand-name drug. <br /><br />Generic pharmaceutical
          drugs are critical to lowering the prices and availability of crucial
          medicines to consumers. Without generic pharmaceutical drugs, many
          would lose access to important medicinal therapies.
